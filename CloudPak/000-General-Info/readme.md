# Cloud Pak General Information

## 1. RedHhat subscriptions and CloudPak licenses

Can a customer use both original RedHhat subscriptions and CloudPak licenses in the same cluster

[Jamie Willie]

FYI ... Is it because a customer is wondering if they can use their existing Openshift Cluster to host CloudPak, either way I don't believe you could do this as a customers OpenShift Cluster would now have different entitlements that have different levels of support.
